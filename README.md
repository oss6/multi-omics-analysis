# Module 5 Data Jamboree

See this for experiment information: https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/63793/pages/data-jamboree-kick-off?module_item_id=2639677.

General notes:

- Partial dependence plots
- Pathway analysis and divide genes into different blocks according to function, likewise for metabolites.
- Or use gene co-expression networks to group genes and obtain blocks for analysis.
- Think about pos v neg datasets
- RGCCA: dimensionality reduction between the two datasets
- iRF: model to predict REF/site?
- WGCNA to find modules related to ...

# Results

## SGCCA

### Full blocks without superblock

### Full blocks with superblock

- Blocks: full matrices
- Superblock: true
- Scheme: factorial
- Permutation
- Sparsity: 0.1175763 (rna), ppolar (0.1359079), superblock (1)
